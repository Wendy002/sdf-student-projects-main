## **6.15 CodeSpace Pets Instagram Profile Project**

### Overview
In this project, I created a simplified version of instagram profile for a user using flexbox and css grid. I included a media query to achieve a responsive design across devices.

### Reflections

#### Areas of Mastery

- **CSS Layout Techniques**: I'm not yet confident in using combination of flexbox and css grid. I find css grid easy to use than flexbox
- **Responsive Design**:  I used a media query to ensure that my webiste is responsive across all screens
- **Styling Elements**: I attempted to style closely to the real instagram  but it is not close enough to the original.

#### Challenges Faced

- **Responsive Design for Smaller Screens**: 
- **Hover and Focus Effects**: 

#### Areas for Improvement

- **Advanced CSS Properties**: 
- **Code Optimization**: 
- **Creative Design Choices**:

#### Overall Learning Experience
