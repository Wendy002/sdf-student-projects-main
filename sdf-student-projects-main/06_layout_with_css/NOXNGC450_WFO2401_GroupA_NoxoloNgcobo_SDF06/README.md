## **6.15 CodeSpace Pets Instagram Profile Project**

### Overview
In this project, I created a simplified version of an Instagram profile for a user using Flexbox and CSS grid. I included a media query to achieve a responsive design across devices.

### Reflections

#### Areas of Mastery

- **CSS Layout Techniques**: I'm not yet confident in using a combination of Flexbox and CSS grid. I find CSS grid easier to use than Flexbox
- **Responsive Design**:  I used a media query to ensure that my website is responsive across all screens
- **Styling Elements**: I attempted to style closely to the real Instagram but it is not close enough to the original. added hover effect on images to display likes and comments when the user hovers over the image. 

#### Challenges Faced

- **Responsive Design for Smaller Screens**: The grid layout on images is still not perfect especially if you shrink the screen, struggled to close the gap without making the images overlap but that failed.
- **Hover and Focus Effects**: Didn't apply any focus effect as I didn't want to overcomplicate my code. I struggled with creating a hover effect with the same box size as the image but instead, I was only able to create a rectangle-shaped box that pops up when you hover over the image 

#### Areas for Improvement

- **Advanced CSS Properties**: I want to work more on CSS layout and responsive web design, and learn to use animations and transformations effectively.

- **Code Optimization**:  Improve on writing clean CSS code by utilizing variables, removing redundant code(code that has little to no effect)
- **Creative Design Choices**: I would like to be able to replicate designs as they are in the future.

#### Overall Learning Experience

This project was a great way to show me areas I need improvement in and also got to use new properties that are really helpful. I look forward to improving my skills and refining this project in the future.
